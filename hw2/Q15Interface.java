/*Objective:Write a program that defines an interface having the following methods:
 *  addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
 *    Create a class that implements this interface and provides appropriate
 *     functionality to carry out the required operations.
 *      Hard code two operands in a test class having a main method that calls
 *       the implementing class. */
